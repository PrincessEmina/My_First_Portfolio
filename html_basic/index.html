    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Princess Emina, a virtual assistant who recently just dived into the tech world.</p>
    <h3>Why am I here?</h3>
    <p>I'm learning Frontend Development with ALX and it has been a rollercoaster</p>
    <p>I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and how to create responsive web design and it has been fun though I know JavaScript is waiting to punch me in my guts</p>
    <h3>Why I chose this path?</h3>
    <p>I love design, creative design, and Frontend allows me to do just that!</p>
